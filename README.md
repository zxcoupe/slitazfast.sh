Slitaz Linux easy install (Asus EEE701 / R2H / etc) for pure (&lt;=650MHz~900MHz CPU's) - SDL 1.2 tuned and compiled any soft (In my case is Hatari - Atari ST emulator).

Hatari last versions compiled with SDL 2.0 and worst worked on 1-1.5GHz. Needed >2GHz. My script compiled Hatari with SDL 1.2 for work fine on <1GHz CPU's (Asus EEE701 and etc). In this case Slitaz Linux as host (can fine work on Asus EEE700 650MHz, RAM256-512Mb, eMMC 2Gb).
